Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is applying knowledge of progragramming languages and engineering principles, methods, and tools to develope and maintenance software systems.
Software engineering enables the creation of software applications and systems that powers various ascepts of modern life and industries such as entertainment, commerces, communication and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The developement of programming langauages such as java, C, Python
The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
The advent of structured programming in the 1970s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning, defining the software's purpose and scope.
Requirements,identify gathering and record the requirements of the final users.
Design, building the framework creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation,develop software according to design specification that is functional, efficient, and user-friendly.
Testing, thorough examination for any glitches or bugs that might be missed during design phase to ensure software runs smoothly according to standards and functional requirements. 
Deployment, Release software to users
Maintenance, constant assistance and improvement to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The Waterfall model is a linear approach to the software development lifecycle that's popular in software engineering and product development
Appropriate for well understood requirement with limited changes expected
-It assumes that no error is ever committed by developers during any phase. Therefore, it does not incorporate any mechanism for error correction
-Difficult to accommodate Change Requests
-Recommends that a new phase can start only after the completion of the previous phase

The Agile methodology emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer-centricity.
Appropriate for unclear or Changing Requirements
-promotes working together and open communication
-Flexible accomadates change request and continuous improvements 
-encourage trying new things and learning from experience

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer, impliments saftware, troubleshoot software issues, fixing and improving software
Quality assurance Engineer, creating ans executing test plans, continuous improvement of testing programs, ensuring compliance to industry standards 
Project manager, project estimation, staffing, scheduling, risk management, Tracking the progress, Liaising with client, Monitoring and reviewing progress, document project report and reporting to client. 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated development environments (IDEs) are programs designed to help developers create applications, providing a place to write and test code. 
IDEs provides a place to write, organise and edit code instructions with features helping developers to identify mistakes and test code during design phase.
Importance
-Code Editors, IDEs provide error-checking to reduce typos and syntax mistakes.Highliting or color text to enable programmer to correct error immediately.
-Code compilers, programming languages are catergorised into two, interpreted nad compiled codes. Interpreted code is written by a programmer and turned into machine code by the system on the fly when the code is executed.Compiled code is created by a developer and then translated from the human-readable programming language into machine code in a process called compiling. IDEs often include compilers to help developers test code sections during the authoring process.
-Debugging and testing, IDEs include the ability to test code and help identify errors or opportunities to make the program run more efficiently. Old code needs to be debudded and new codes needs to be tested. 
Version Control Systems (VCS) are software tools that allows developers to write code in various programming languages with the ability to customize features through extensions
Importance
-Extensible, ability to add functionality through a wide range of extensions for different languages, frameworks, and tools.
-Accessibility and Flexibility, It's free, open-source, and works seamlessly across Windows, macOS, and Linux
-Customizable with Plugins, vast ecosystem of plugins allows users to tailor the editor to their specific needs, adding features for debugging, code formatting, linting
-Integrated Git Support, developers can manage their Git repositories


-Software security, cyber security and developing safe software is ongoing challange for developers, active and continuous reasearch for implementing secure software to defend from hacking, phising and malware.
-Limited infrastructure, shortage of IT resources and IT infrastructure Software engineers must rely heavily on a robust infrastructure to perform their jobs effectively
-Technological advancements The rapid pace of technological advancement places considerable pressure on software engineers. continuous learning practices and using agile methodologies to adapt to emerging trends.
-Time Constraints Software engineering is a demanding and time-intensive field, effective time management strategies are essential.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing: Focuses on testing individual functions or methods within a code module to ensure they work correctly on their own.
Integration testing: Tests how different modules or components of a system interact with each other to identify issues related to data flow or communication between them.
System testing: Evaluates the entire software system as a whole, testing its functionality in different scenarios and under various conditions to ensure it meets overall requirements.
Acceptance testing:
Involves end users or stakeholders to verify if the system meets their expectations and is ready for deployment, often including user acceptance testing (UAT). 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the process of writing instructions to get the best results from an AI model. 
Prompt engineering helps avoid that by making your questions clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what you need

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
